WebGL Project

This project is a WebGL application that displays an array of cubes organized into 'chunks', similar to the chunks used in Minecraft.

Files:

- main.js: The main JavaScript file that initializes the WebGL context, sets up shaders, buffers, and textures, and renders the scene.

- shaders.js: Contains the vertex and fragment shader source code.

- util.js: Contains utility functions for initializing WebGL, resizing the canvas, and loading textures.

- scene.js: Contains the function to draw the scene, including setting up the projection and model-view matrices.

- cube.html: The HTML file that contains the canvas element and includes the main.js file.

- objects.js: Contains the vertex and index data for the cube objects.

- buffers.js: Contains functions for creating and managing buffers.

- transforms.js: Contains utility functions for matrix transformations.
